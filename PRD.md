## Essential Features

### Visual App Builder
- **Functionality**: Drag-and-drop component placement with live preview and property editing
- **Purpose**: Enables rapid prototyping without coding knowledge while maintaining code quality
- **Trigger**: User selects component from palette or uses AI generation prompt
- **Progression**: Component selection → Canvas placement → Property adjustment → Preview update → Code generation
- **Success criteria**: Components render correctly, properties sync bidirectionally, generated code is production-ready

### AI-Powered Component Generation
- **Functionality**: Natural language to component conversion with intelligent suggestions
- **Purpose**: Accelerates development by understanding user intent and generating appropriate solutions
- **Trigger**: User types description or speaks into voice interface
- **Progression**: Intent capture → AI processing → Component suggestion → User refinement → Integration
- **Success criteria**: Generated components match intent >90% accuracy, suggestions improve over time

### Real-time Collaboration
- **Functionality**: Multi-user editing with conflict resolution and change tracking
- **Purpose**: Enables team development and real-time feedback loops
- **Trigger**: User shares project or joins collaborative session
- **Progression**: Session creation → User invitation → Live cursor tracking → Change synchronization → Conflict resolution
- **Success criteria**: Changes sync within 200ms, no data loss during conflicts

### Multi-Chain AI Orchestration
- **Functionality**: Intelligent routing of tasks to optimal AI models based on context and performance
- **Purpose**: Maximizes output quality while minimizing latency and cost
- **Trigger**: Any AI-requiring operation (generation, analysis, optimization)
- **Progression**: Task analysis → Chain selection → Model routing → Result aggregation → Quality validation
- **Success criteria**: 30% improvement in response quality, 50% reduction in processing time

## Edge Case Handling

- **Network Failures**: Offline mode with local AI models and sync on reconnect
- **Invalid AI Responses**: Fallback to template-based generation with user notification
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Progressive degradation with feature prioritization
- **Corrupted Projects**: Automatic backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Concurrent Edits**: Operational transform with user-friendly conflict resolution UI

## Design Direction

The design should feel cutting-edge and intelligent while maintaining elegance and clarity - a sophisticated creative tool that showcases advanced AI capabilities without overwhelming users. Rich interface with contextual panels and smart defaults better serves the complex workflows of professional developers and designers.

## Color Selection

Triadic (three equally spaced colors) - Creates visual harmony while providing sufficient contrast for complex interface hierarchies, using deep blues for trust/stability, vibrant oranges for action/creativity, and muted greens for success/completion states.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Space Blue (oklch(0.25 0.15 250)) - Conveys technological sophistication and reliability
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Slate Gray (oklch(0.45 0.02 250)) - Professional neutrals for backgrounds and secondary elements
  - Warm White (oklch(0.98 0.005 80)) - Clean, readable surfaces
- **Accent Color**: Electric Orange (oklch(0.68 0.18 45)) - High-energy color for CTAs and active states
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Warm White oklch(0.98 0.005 80)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.15 0.01 250)) - Ratio 15.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Pure White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.15 0.01 250)) - Ratio 16.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Space Blue oklch(0.25 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.9:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Slate Gray oklch(0.45 0.02 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓
  - Accent (Electric Orange oklch(0.68 0.18 45)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.15 0.01 250)) - Ratio 6.2:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey precision and modernity while maintaining excellent readability across complex interfaces - Inter for its technical clarity and geometric precision, perfect for a developer-focused creative tool.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing (-0.02em)
  - H2 (Panel Titles): Inter SemiBold/20px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Section Headers): Inter Medium/16px/normal spacing
  - Body (UI Text): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height (1.5)
  - Code (Generated Output): JetBrains Mono Regular/13px/normal spacing
  - Small (Hints/Labels): Inter Regular/12px/loose letter spacing (0.01em)

## Animations

Animations should feel intelligent and purposeful - smooth micro-interactions that provide instant feedback combined with sophisticated transitions that showcase the platform's advanced capabilities.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates AI processing states, data flow, and system intelligence through organic, flowing animations
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: 
  - Critical feedback (errors, confirmations): Immediate spring animations
  - AI processing: Subtle pulse/breathing effects
  - Component interactions: Smooth 200ms ease-out transitions
  - Page transitions: Coordinated slide/fade combinations

## Component Selection

- **Components**: 
  - Dialog/Sheet for AI chat interface and settings
  - Card for component palette and property panels  
  - Tabs for switching between design/code/preview modes
  - Slider/Input for numeric properties with live preview
  - Button with loading states for AI operations
- **Customizations**: 
  - Canvas component for drag-drop surface with snap guides
  - AI chat bubble component with typing indicators
  - Property inspector with grouped, collapsible sections
  - Component tree with drag-reorder and visual hierarchy
- **States**: Buttons show processing/success/error states, inputs provide real-time validation, dropdowns include search/filter capabilities
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for technical actions (code, settings, AI), geometric shapes for creativity
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px grid system with 16px/24px/32px major intervals
- **Mobile**: Responsive layout collapses to tabbed interface, touch-optimized controls, simplified AI interaction patterns
